# TODO
* Add GUI
* Hide console window(requires adding a hotkey to turn off or an icon in the tray to call GUI)
* Rewrite the input processing of replacement keys
* Add pop-up notifications with a suggestion to add a value when the user has entered a non-existent key
* Add hints for keys (if possible)
